The 'Oly Cow: FTC '13-'14
=========================

The code for The 'Oly Cow's 2013-2014 robot (team 6424). You are welcome to use our code, although there is no warranty :P

An explanation of the code will be added shortly--of course, it would help to actually have code :)
Also, our code is pretty specific to our robot, but the #pragma motor/servo assignments should make it reasonably clear.
If you dare to read on, remember that this is all still very preliminary :)

-------------------------
In our "\RobotC\" folder, there are 4 sub-folders: Documentation, Headers, Libraries, and Resources.

# "\Documentation\"
Includes documentation on what everything does -  so when you're done reading this, go take a look at that :)

# "\Headers\"
Includes headers that some (or all) programs may use; if you don't want to read documentation you can try reading this.

# "\Libraries\"
Includes the actual ".c" files which some of the headers are for. I think they should compile?

# "\Resources\"
Includes some sound files (".rso") that we might attempt to play. However, competitions are usually too noisy :(
